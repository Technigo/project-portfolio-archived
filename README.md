Project: Created my personal portfolio for career purposes. 

The focus was to create a professional looking portfolio following a design mockup given to us by Technigo.

This will be updated along the course of the bootcamp to display all my future projects and newly gained skills that I want to share with the world. 

The website itself is built with only HTML and CSS and has been made responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop. 
Furthermore I have added aria labels for accessibility purposes and have run the web site through wave and w3 validators as well as testing the page with voice over on mac.
